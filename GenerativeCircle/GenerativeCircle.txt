PROMPT: **** create a program in processing that draws a circle ****

I'll help you create a simple Processing program that draws a circle. Here's a basic example: [1]

void setup() {
  // Set up the window size
  size(400, 400);
  // Set the background color to white
  background(255);
}

void draw() {
  // Set the circle's fill color to blue
  fill(0, 0, 255);
  // Set the circle's outline color to black
  stroke(0);
  // Draw a circle in the center of the window
  // Parameters: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, diameter
  circle(width/2, height/2, 200);
}

Copy

This program will:

Create a 400x400 pixel window

Set a white background

Draw a blue circle with a black outline

The circle will be centered in the window (at position 200,200)

The circle will have a diameter of 200 pixels

You can modify the following aspects of the circle:

Change the size by modifying the last parameter in the circle() function

Change the position by modifying the first two parameters

Change the color by modifying the values in the fill() function (using RGB values)

Remove the outline by using noStroke()

Change the outline thickness using strokeWeight()

For example, to make a red circle with no outline:

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  background(255);
}

void draw() {
  noStroke();
  fill(255, 0, 0);
  circle(width/2, height/2, 200);
}
